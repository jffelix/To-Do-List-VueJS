# To-Do-List-VueJS

Welcome to my To-Do List application using VueJS! This application was completed in 2 days with the intention of learning VueJS for the first time and implementing CRUD operations. Similar to my React Hooks and Angular versions of the To-Do List, simply input a name and quantity, click the sumbit button, and a new entry will be added to the grocery list. Update and delete features have been added as well.

## Accomplishments
- Learned setting up bolierplate for VueJS
- Implemented full CRUD operations using VueJS

## Notable Features
- Ability to add new items to the list
- Update feature to modify selected items
- Delete to remove selected items
- Full list toggles off to display update form

## Future goals
- Implement back-end using a SQL database
